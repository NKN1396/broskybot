# BroskyBot
A bot for a few private servers I'm in. This code is highly custom and probably not salvagable for other projects. 

## Usage
### Setup
1. Rename `token.example.json` to `token.json` and paste your token in there.
1. Don't forget to install all dependencies (e.g. `npm i`).

### Running
Start the bot with `npm start`.
